# landing-page
Odin Project Landing Page project
For this project I built a landing page for a website based off of a design given to me by the Odin Project. I learned how to position design layouts using Flexbox and was able to accomplish the proper design with a few hiccups along the way. I did not know how to round off corners of boxes at first so that was one of the few things that I had to look up. I also did not know how to make my webpage scroll when content went off the screen but that was solved with a quick google search.
